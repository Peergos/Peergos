File: Math.uuid.js
Version: 1.3
Change History:
  v1.0 - first release
  v1.1 - less code and 2x performance boost (by minimizing calls to Math.random())
  v1.2 - Add support for generating non-standard uuids of arbitrary length
  v1.3 - Fixed IE7 bug (can't use []'s to access string chars.  Thanks, Brian R.)
  v1.4 - Changed method to be "Math.uuid". Added support for radix argument.  Use module pattern for better encapsulation.
