        <h3>Add user-to-user messaging to your app.</h3>
        <p>Your users can <a href="https://xmpp-ftw.jit.su/manual/core/#send-a-message" target="_blank">send direct messages 
        to each other</a>. Even better, Buddycloud's federated design means that your users can communicate with millions of 
        other existing users that already run Buddycloud.</p>

        <p><a href="http://buddycloud.com/api#create-post" target="_blank">Multi-user and group messaging</a> is

        <p>Each of your users can also have a <a href="http://buddycloud.com/api#channels">Personal Channel</a>. Personal

        <h3>One pattern to learn, everything is publish-subscribe.</h3>
        <p>Whether it's posts in a channel or user-to-user messages, Buddycloud uses a publish-subscribe pattern for messaging.
        Building on Pub/Sub gives easy querying for message history, guaranteed message delivery and a decoupling of publishers
        and subscribers who don't need to both be online at the same time.  All this means you can use the same logic for your
        mobile and web applications.</p>

        <p>Ever had that problem when your code worked perfect in your local environment but failed when it was deployed to

        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-vm" target="_blank">Buddycloud-VM</a> and 
        <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/saltstack" target="_blank">Saltstack</a> give you identical code, services and

        <h3>Access to a rich code ecosystem.</h3>
        <p>There's a bunch of <a href="http://buddycloud.com/software-stack" target="_blank">existing Buddycloud open source

        the right direction.</p>

        <p>Buddycloud uses a push-to-pull content update pattern:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>When your user is online (the application is running in the foreground), new content is automatically 
        streamed to them.</li>
        <li>When your user is offline (the application is suspended), the 
        <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-pusher" target="_blank">Buddycloud Pusher</a> will trigger a push 
        notification to the mobile device and the application can trigger a background pull.</li>
        <li>When your user clicks on the push notification, the new content is already downloaded and waiting for them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Even more cat pictures.</h3>
        <p>Wouldn't it be nice to have file sharing that just works? Buddycloud ships with integrated file sharing so that your 
        users can drag-and-drop files into their channel and they are securely shared with their followers.</p>
        <p>The Buddycloud <a href="https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-server-java" target="_blank">Media Server</a> 
        supports any file types including images and videos. Image sharing comes with thumbnail previews for images including 
        a max-height or max-width constraint for flexible embedding on different screen sizes.</p>

        <p>Other companies build services that lock you into using them. However, we believe communication is better when

        control of your userbase and privacy, your users can connect, share and message with users on all other 
        Buddycloud-enabled apps.</p>
