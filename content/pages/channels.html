	<p>Buddycloud is a revolutionary new design where anyone can run their own
		Buddycloud server, and each Buddycloud server will find, connect and share the
		data you choose with users on other Buddycloud servers.</p>
	<p>This approach has huge benefits, especially for industries that care
		about data privacy (Finance, Medicine).</p>

	<h2>Buddycloud uses channels</h2>
	<p>
		A channel is a collection of activity feeds and value-stores that can have
		publishers, and subscribers. Buddycloud channels can scale up to millions of
		followers or scale down to be used as an individual data-store. A channel
		looks like
		<code>user@example.com</code>
	</p>

	</figure>
	<p>channels look like</p>
	<table class="table table-striped">
		<tr>
			<th>Channel Address</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>user@example.com</td>
			<td>A user's channel</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>user@other-domain.com</td>
			<td>A buddycloud channel on a remote site</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>customer-support@company.com</td>
			<td>A channel that anyone can post into and get support</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br />
	<h2>Channels are a bundle of nodes</h2>
	<p>
		Each channel is made up of application nodes. When you follow a channel, for
		example,
		<code>user@example.com</code>
		you are really following a collection of application nodes. (
		<code>user@example.com/posts</code>
		,
		<code>user@example.com/public-key</code>
		,
		<code>user@example.com/geolocation</code>
		, etc). Any updates to a node are pushed out to all followers of the channel.
		So when you want to build your application on Buddycloud you simply use an
		existing application node or create a new one for your projects specific
		needs.

	<p>Each Application node can have different stream formats, different
		metadata fields and different stream lengths (single item vs infinite items).</p>
	<table class="table table-striped">
		<tr>
			<th>Channel and Application node name</th>
			<th>Example</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>user@example.com/posts</td>

		<tr>
			<td>user@example.com/selfies-application</td>
			<td>One or more, activitystream for a selfies application</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>user@example.com/public-key</td>
			<td>A single public key that can be used to encrypt messages to <code>user@example.com</code>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>user@example.com/geolocation</td>
			<td>An application updates the users location and all followers receive
				the update</td>

	<h2>Channel synchronization</h2>
	<p>Buddycloud channels are synchronized across Buddycloud sites</p>
	<p>
		You post data in a channel (for example
		<code>user@example.com/posts</code>
		) and the update is synchronized to followers on the local and remote
		Buddycloud servers. The Buddycloud server will also take care of "catching-up"
		from remote sites if it has been offline.
	</p>
	<p>

	<h2>Personal and Topic channels</h2>
	<p>There are two different types of channels. Personal channels and
		Topic/Group/Application channels.</p>

	<h2>Channel privacy</h2>
	<p>Each channel can have different privacy models</p>
	<table class="table table-striped">

	</table>
	<br />
	<h2>Channel Roles</h2>
	<p>Channel followers have have different roles. Most of the time you will
		not need them but roles can help keep the social aspect flowing.</p>
	<table class="table table-striped">
		<tr>
			<th>Role</th>
			<th>What can they do?</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Owner</td>

	</table>
	<p>Channel owners can set the default role for new followers. For example:
		new followers will inherit the follower+post role.</p>
	<h2>Authenticate against your existing database of users</h2>
	<p>Buddycloud has a number of ways to authenticate against your existing
		database of users.</p>

			<th>How it works</th>
			<th>Use case</th>

			<td>Parallel secret</td>
			<td>Your application generates a secret to be used with the buddycloud
				service</td>
